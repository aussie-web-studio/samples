Below are some of the best practices and configuration recommendations for securing Amazon S3 buckets:<br/><br/>### Security Best Practices<br/>#### Disable Access Control Lists (ACLs)<br/>- **S3 Object Ownership**: Use S3 Object Ownership to control ownership of objects uploaded to your bucket and to disable or enable ACLs.<br/>- **Default Setting**: By default, Object Ownership is set to the Bucket owner enforced setting and all ACLs are disabled.<br/>- **Recommendation**: Disable ACLs, except in unusual circumstances where you must control access for each object individually. Disabling ACLs simplifies permissions management and auditing.<br/><br/>#### Ensure Buckets Are Not Publicly Accessible<br/>- **S3 Block Public Access**: Use S3 Block Public Access to set up centralized controls to limit public access to your Amazon S3 resources.<br/>- **Policy and ACL Review**: Identify and modify any bucket policies or access control lists (ACLs) that allow public access.<br/><br/>### Adding a Bucket Policy<br/>To add a bucket policy using the Amazon S3 console:<br/>1. Open the Amazon S3 console.<br/>2. Choose the bucket for which you want to create or edit a bucket policy.<br/>3. Navigate to the **Permissions** tab.<br/>4. Under **Bucket policy**, choose **Edit**.<br/>5. You can generate a policy automatically using the **AWS Policy Generator** or edit the JSON in the **Policy** section.<br/>6. After adding statements, choose **Generate Policy**.<br/>7. Copy the generated policy text and paste it into the **Policy** box in the Amazon S3 console.<br/>8. Resolve any security warnings, errors, general warnings, and suggestions before saving your policy.<br/><br/>### Further Recommendations<br/>- **IAM Access Analyzer**: Use IAM Access Analyzer to validate your policy against IAM policy grammar and best practices.<br/>- **Policy Examples**: For examples of bucket policies, refer to the [Examples of Amazon S3 bucket policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/example-bucket-policies.html) in the Amazon S3 User Guide.<br/><br/>For more detailed information, please refer to the [Security best practices for Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/security-best-practices.html) and [Adding a bucket policy by using the Amazon S3 console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/add-bucket-policy.html) documentation pages.<br/></body></html>
